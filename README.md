[AIDA GUI github pages preview](https://ourbunka.github.io/aidadiffusion)

Watch [vdeo Demo here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lm7o4PX-rI)

*AIDA GUI required "AIDAdiffusion.exe" running in your local pc or cloud server to function properly

*currently github pages version seem to have issues connecting with locally hosted AIDAdiffusion.exe(github pages seem to automatically convert http to https?),
we recommend using locally hosted AIDA GUI [http://localhost:9998/files/build.](http://localhost:9998/files/build)
